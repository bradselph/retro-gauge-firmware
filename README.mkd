Retro Gauge Arduino Source Code
================================

## Dependencies

Besides a standard Arduino development environment, the firmware also requires
the [SwitecX25 library](https://github.com/clearwater/SwitecX25) to drive the
stepper motor.

This library is based on [Guy Carpenter's Gaugette project][gaugette].
