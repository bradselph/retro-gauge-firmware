Retro Gauge Arduino Source Code
================================

## Dependencies

Besides a standard Arduino development environment, the firmware also requires
the [SwitecX25 library](http://guy.carpenter.id.au/gaugette/about/) to drive the
stepper motor. This library is based on [Guy Carpenter's Gaugette project][gaugette]
